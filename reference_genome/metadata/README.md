## Here are associated metadata for the cheiro reference genome which needed to be stitched in order to run alignment steps.
* The final reference genome and dictionaries etc can be found at this path on the DCC cluster /datacommons/yoderlab/users/hkania/cheiro/reference_genome
  * Hannah may need to change permissions for other researchers to access in the future. Just reach out if necessary! The files are quite large to host here.
